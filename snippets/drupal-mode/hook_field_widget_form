/**
 * ${2:Return the form for a single field widget.
 *
 * Field widget form elements should be based on the passed-in $element, which
 * contains the base form element properties derived from the field
 * configuration.
 *
 * Field API will set the weight, field name and delta values for each form
 * element. If there are multiple values for this field, the Field API will
 * invoke this hook as many times as needed.
 *
 * Note that, depending on the context in which the widget is being included
 * (regular entity form, field configuration form, advanced search form...),
 * the values for $field and $instance might be different from the "official"
 * definitions returned by field_info_field() and field_info_instance().
 * Examples: mono-value widget even if the field is multi-valued, non-required
 * widget even if the field is 'required'...
 *
 * Therefore, the FAPI element callbacks (such as #process, #element_validate,
 * #value_callback...) used by the widget cannot use the field_info_field()
 * or field_info_instance() functions to retrieve the $field or $instance
 * definitions they should operate on. The field_widget_field() and
 * field_widget_instance() functions should be used instead to fetch the
 * current working definitions from $form_state, where Field API stores them.
 *
 * Alternatively, hook_field_widget_form() can extract the needed specific
 * properties from $field and $instance and set them as ad-hoc
 * $element['#custom'] properties, for later use by its element callbacks.
 *
 * Other modules may alter the form element provided by this function using
 * hook_field_widget_form_alter().
 *}
 * @param $form
 *   The form structure where widgets are being attached to. This might be a
 *   full form structure, or a sub-element of a larger form.
 * @param $form_state
 *   An associative array containing the current state of the form.
 * @param $field
 *   The field structure.
 * @param $instance
 *   The field instance.
 * @param $langcode
 *   The language associated with $items.
 * @param $items
 *   Array of default values for this field.
 * @param $delta
 *   The order of this item in the array of subelements (0, 1, 2, etc).
 * @param $element
 *   A form element array containing basic properties for the widget:
 *   - #entity_type: The name of the entity the field is attached to.
 *   - #bundle: The name of the field bundle the field is contained in.
 *   - #field_name: The name of the field.
 *   - #language: The language the field is being edited in.
 *   - #field_parents: The 'parents' space for the field in the form. Most
 *       widgets can simply overlook this property. This identifies the
 *       location where the field values are placed within
 *       $form_state['values'], and is used to access processing information
 *       for the field through the field_form_get_state() and
 *       field_form_set_state() functions.
 *   - #columns: A list of field storage columns of the field.
 *   - #title: The sanitized element label for the field instance, ready for
 *     output.
 *   - #description: The sanitized element description for the field instance,
 *     ready for output.
 *   - #required: A Boolean indicating whether the element value is required;
 *     for required multiple value fields, only the first widget's values are
 *     required.
 *   - #delta: The order of this item in the array of subelements; see $delta
 *     above.
 *
 * @return
 *   The form elements for a single widget for this field.
